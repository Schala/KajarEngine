# MISSION OBJECTIVE
OpenCT is NOT a Chrono Trigger remake, but an engine implementation (ie. D2X, OpenMW, GZDoom) that uses the existing user-provided game data to provide a better experience than what Square Enix has offered. As of this project's founding, the Steam port of Chrono Trigger is horribly bug ridden, even 5 years after its release. Subsequent patches still leave the game in disarray. This project aims to use the [Bevy Engine](https://bevyengine.org/) to deliver a better experience than the one based off Cocos 2D that Square-Enix used.

# NOTICE
This project REQUIRES you own a copy of the Steam port of Chrono Trigger, as this is just the engine and pulls from a legally purchased copy of Chrono Trigger.

# CONTRIBUTOR RESTRICTIONS
No disassembly of the existing game or assets may be contributed to this project. This includes modded assets.
